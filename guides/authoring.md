# Authoring Prompts

**Structure:**
- Front‑matter with metadata (see schema)
- Body with sections: System, User template, Guidance for human operator

**Good practice:**
- Give the model role + constraints (what it must NOT do)
- Add 1–2 concrete examples
- Add evaluation criteria (how we know it worked)
